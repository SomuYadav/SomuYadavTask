# What I Delivered in the Project

- Built the app entirely in **Swift (latest version)**, ensuring compatibility with the current Xcode and iOS SDK.  
- Implemented the **UI programmatically using UIKit**, following Appleâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines and coding best practices.  
- Focused on **performance optimization**, keeping CPU, memory, and energy usage efficient for a smooth user experience.  
- Applied a **scalable MVVM architecture** with clear separation of concerns, resulting in loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable code.  
- Designed a **clean, responsive UI** with tasteful customizations and smooth animations to elevate the user experience.  
- Kept **third-party dependencies minimal**, avoiding unnecessary frameworks for a lightweight build.  
- Ensured the app works **seamlessly offline**, with proper caching and fallback handling.  
- Added **unit tests with good coverage**, ensuring correctness and long-term maintainability.  
- Verified that the app compiles with **zero warnings** in the latest Xcode, adapts correctly across all supported iOS devices, and avoids **Auto Layout conflicts** during runtime.
